# DeepLearning

In this repository, I keep deep learning projects I have worked on during a Deep Learning tutorial at Minerva Schools at KGI.

Set of projects:

1. Used seq2seq encoder-decoder model for Bach Chorale Harmonization
2. Used DCGAN(Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) and CGAN (Conditional Generative Adversarial Network) to generate images of sheet music.
